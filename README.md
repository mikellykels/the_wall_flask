## Project "The Wall"

##### Build out your database and make sure to connect it by entering the information on the `server.py` file.
##### Use `walldb.mwb` for table and column names in your database.
##### Check `mysqlconnection.py` to make sure everything is correct.  

1. To run, open your terminal and go to the folder where the `server.py` file is in.
2. Then, enter `python server.py` to start the server up.
3. Open your browser and go to `localhost:5000`
